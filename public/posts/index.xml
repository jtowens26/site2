      <description>To my connections applying to graduate school this cycle, below are some excellent resources and annotated examples to help you prepare a great personal statement!
(1) https://lnkd.in/d_RFWbq
(2) https://lnkd.in/dawccfn
(3) https://lnkd.in/dgUjiUa
Note that the annotated statements are all very different, which is a good thing. There is no winning formula and you can write your statements in a way that best suits you and your experiences. These were helpful in informing me of which content to include and how I could most effectively make a case for admission.</description>

      <description>After several online tutorials, and some on-again, off-again debugging, my personal website is up and running! I will use this site as a longer-standing version of my LinkedIn profile, documenting relevant updates and content as I make my way through graduate school. Thanks for stopping by!
