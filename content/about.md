An engineer by training, I desire to leverage my research expertise and business education in solving problems that make renewable technologies more equitable and commercially viable.

To this end, I will pursue a PhD in Chemical Engineering Practice at MIT (Fall 2020) and, afterward, an MBA at the Sloan School of Management. Before grad school, I graduated from Virginia Tech with an honors degree in Chemical Engineering and a minor in Chemistry.

I have been fortunate to pursue opportunities spanning corporate R&D and manufacturing at ExxonMobil, energy policy at the University of Cape Town, and several research projects. My research has broadly surveyed renewable materials and processes, with focuses in electrochemical synthesis, nanocellulose, and modeling.

I am always eager to connect, learn, and share with others. So please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or contact me directly if you would like to chat.
